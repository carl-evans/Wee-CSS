# Purpose
More and more people are exploring utility-first aka functional CSS as a serious alternative to other approaches to writing scalable and maintainable CSS, such as BEM and SMACSS. This is a small collection of Sass files that will generate a huge number of helpful utility classes that you can drop right into your current project. To get the most out of Wee CSS, you should absolutely use a tool to remove unused CSS such as PurgeCSS. I built this because I was not fully satisfied with the naming conventions in other utility frameworks, wanted an easier way to configure my design system, and to fine-tune the classes based on the designs I build each day. You are welcome to use this for learning, exploring utility-first CSS, or in your own projects. It's free.
